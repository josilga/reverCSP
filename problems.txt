Current expression:
(a -> b -> P [|{|a|}|] (a -> b -> P [|{|a|}|] R))

These are the available options: 
1 .- P from (7,15) to (7,16)
	\__ (a -> b -> P [|{|a|}|] (a -> b -> P [|{|a|}|] R))
2 .- P from (7,15) to (7,16)
	\__ (a -> b -> P [|{|a|}|] (a -> b -> P [|{|a|}|] R))

- Double sync edge 

- Repeated events in reverse trace
